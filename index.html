		 My name is Marlin and I’m a PhD student of theoretical physics in Hannover, Germany. I’m currently employed by the Max-Planck society (MPG) and working on deep learning applications to gravitational wave data analysis and astronomy. Specifically, I'm mostly concerned with developing neural networks that are capable of detecting signals in very noisy time series data. For an easy to understand summary of my work you can head to the <a href="/pages/science_digest.html">"Science Digest"</a> section of this website. If you are interested in my publications you can find them in the <a href="/pages/publications.html">"Publications"</a> section of this site (manually updated), on <a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/1869013?ui-citation-summary=true">INSPIRE-HEP</a> (automatically updated), or on ORCID <a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6990-0627" target="blank">https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6990-0627</a> (semi-automatically updated).

		 In my free time I like to play badminton, go bouldering, think about some odd questions, or play video games. Other than that I'm interested in cars and technology in general. Badminton has been a large part of my life since grade school and I've been playing ever since. Since September 2019 I’ve also started to teach a group of kids at my local sports club how to play badminton. I really enjoy seeing how quickly they progress and how much fun they have doing so. Bouldering has been a relatively new addition to my hobbies and it's been more of an on and off activity during Corona. However, when one gets onto the wall with friends it's always a lot of fun and I hope to be able to do this more regularly in the future. If you want to know more about my thoughts on a few random questions, you can take a look at the <a href="/pages/blog.html">blog posts</a> I'm writing. A few larger projects are also listed in the <a href="/pages/personal_projects.html">"Personal Projects"</a> section of this website.
