        Throughout my years I've started a few larger scale projects. Some of these and their progress are described below. I also often think about smaller questions and project ideas. A few are documented in my <a href="/pages/blog.html">blog posts</a>.

            I've decided to create a personal website after reading a
            paper by Emily Moravec summarizing different choices one can
            make along the way. If you want to have a read of the paper
            yourself, you can download it from arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08553" target="blank">here</a>
            or access the published version <a href="https://arxiv.org/ct?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdx.doi.org%2F10.3847%2F25c2cfeb.53f6dcad&v=e73115b6" target="blank">here</a>.
            Below I will describe my way to building this website and
            some choices I made along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            The last time I had done any "web-development" was more than
            10 years ago for a small school project. Back then we used
            HTML4 if I remember correctly and I re-did the entire site
            the night before we had to hand it in. You may be able to 
            imagine how much of that knowledge was still with me. On top
            of the knowledge lost to the never-stopping passage of time
            we had never talked about web-hosting and I'm not sure to
            which degree we had worked with CSS back then. Therefore, 
            the initial learning curve was rather steep. And I'm by no
            means a professional by now. So if you find any problems on
            this website, please get in touch and let me know. You can
            find my contact information <a href="/pages/contact.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first choice was considering where I wanted to host the
            website, as that would directly impact the way I would 
            actually build it. I did not want to spend a lot of
            money on this website, as this felt more like an experiment 
            and also because the traffic would most certainly be low. 
            Following Figure 2 of the paper mentioned above and avoiding
            to use my institute as a host, I chose to use github-pages. 
            I wanted to avoid using my institute simply for the reason 
            that I will most probably shift employers after completing
            my PhD. If the website was hosted by the institute, I 
            would have to remember to copy it over to a new host then. 
            Using an external host removes this source of error.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choosing github-pages as a hosting service also meant that I
            would have to use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="blank">Jekyll</a>
            to build the website. Jekyll is an automated tool to build
            static websites, i.e. websites which are not rendered on the
            server on request. It simplifies the process by allowing the
            user to specify templates that govern the overall look of
            the website. The templates may then be adjusted to create a
            personalized look. It also allows to make use of a few
            automated tools to loop over files and build the website
            from its contents. This means for instance that building a
            menu is relatively simple.
        </p>
        <p>
            After having chosen Jekyll to build the website it would in
            theory have been as simple as choosing a template (like 
            <a href="https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/" target="blank">Minimal mistakes</a>)
            and filling it with content. However, I had no (real) 
            experience with web development. And I saw this website as
            an opportunity to change that. So instead of using a
            ready-to-use template, I decided to build this website from
            the ground up. Not because it is efficient (I think I could
            have created this website in 10 hours instead of 50-60) but
            because I see it as a learning experience. Looking back at
            it now I can already see many places where it is
            inefficiently coded and where it is actually hard to
            understand what happens. But I'm proud of having gotten it
            into a function state.

        <p>
            PyTrest is a Python package that I created to test stock
            market trading strategies and build a virtual depot to do
            paper trading in. When I started getting into the stock market
            I wanted to utilize my data analysis background and see if I
            was able to play the game of statistics to come up with some
            efficient trading strategies. My main problem was that
            most off-the-shelf libraries did not consider comission
            costs and taxes, which are a major factor (at least with 
            small capital). Also, for some of these libraries the syntax
            seemed so obscure that it was difficult to impossible to get
            the raw data into the library. To resolve these issues I
            decided to write my own library. I also wanted to use this
            experience to learn about library design and package
            architecture. If you want to have a look at the source code
            you can find it on my github page <a href="https://github.com/MarlinSchaefer/PyTrest" target="blank">here</a>.
