  abstract: "Gravitational waves are now observed routinely. Therefore, data analysis has to keep up with ever improving detectors. One relatively new tool to search for gravitational wave signals in detector data are machine learning algorithms that utilize deep neuralnnetworks. The first successful application was able to differentiate time series strain data that contains a gravitational wave from a binary black hole merger from data that consists purely of noise. This work expands the analysis to signals from binary neutron star mergers, where a rapid detection is most valuable, as electromagnetic counterparts might otherwise be missed or not observed for long enough. We showcase many different architecture, discuss what choices improved the sensitivity of our search and introduce a new multi-rate approach. We find that the final algorithm gives state of the art performance in comparison to other search pipelines that use deep neural networks. On the other hand we also conclude that our analysis is not yet able to achieve sensitivities that are on par with template based searches. We report our results at false alarm rates down to ~30 samples/month which has not been tested by other neural network algorithms. We hope to provide information about useful architectural choices and improve our algorithm in the future to achieve sensitivities and false alarm rates that rival matched filtering based approaches on."

  abstract: "As two neutron stars merge, they emit gravitational waves that can potentially be detected by Earth-bound detectors. Matched-filtering-based algorithms have traditionally been used to extract quiet signals embedded in noise. We introduce a novel neural-network-based machine learning algorithm that uses time series strain data from gravitational-wave detectors to detect signals from nonspinning binary neutron star mergers. For the Advanced LIGO design sensitivity, our network has an average sensitive distance of 130 Mpc at a false-alarm rate of ten per month. Compared to other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, we find an improvement by a factor of 4 in sensitivity to signals with a signal-to-noise ratio between 8 and 15. However, this approach is not yet competitive with traditional matched-filtering-based methods. A conservative estimate indicates that our algorithm introduces on average 10.2 s of latency between signal arrival and generating an alert. We give an exact description of our testing procedure, which can be applied not only to machine-learning-based algorithms but all other search algorithms as well. We thereby improve the ability to compare machine learning and classical searches."

  abstract: "We present the prospects for the early (pre-merger) detection and localization of compact-binary coalescences using gravitational waves over the next 10 yr. Early warning can enable the direct observation of the prompt and early electromagnetic emission of a neutron star merger. We examine the capabilities of the ground-based detectors at their “Design” sensitivity (2021–2022), the planned “A+” upgrade (2024–2026), and the envisioned “Voyager” concept (late 2020s). We find that for a fiducial rate of binary neutron star mergers of 1000 Gpc^−3 yr^−1, the Design, A+, and Voyager era networks can provide 18, 54, and 195 s of warning for one source per year of observing, respectively, with a sky localization area <100 deg^2 at a 90% credible level. At the same rate, the A+ and Voyager era networks will be able to provide 9 and 43 s of warning, respectively, for a source with <10 deg^2 localization area. We compare the idealized search sensitivity to that achieved by the PyCBC Live search tuned for pre-merger detection. The gravitational-wave community will be prepared to produce pre-merger alerts. Our results motivate the operation of observatories with wide fields of view, automation, and the capability for fast slewing to observe simultaneously with the gravitational-wave network."

  abstract: "We present the third open gravitational-wave catalog (3-OGC) of compact-binary coalescences, based on the analysis of the public LIGO and Virgo data from 2015 through 2019 (O1, O2, O3a). Our updated catalog includes a population of 57 observations, including 4 binary black hole mergers that had not been previously reported. This consists of 55 binary black hole mergers and the 2 binary neutron star mergers, GW170817 and GW190425. We find no additional significant binary neutron star or neutron star–black hole merger events. The most confident new detection is the binary black hole merger GW190925_232845, which was observed by the LIGO–Hanford and Virgo observatories with its primary and secondary component masses are and , respectively. We estimate the parameters of all binary black hole events using an up-to-date waveform model that includes both subdominant harmonics and precession effects. To enable deep follow up as our understanding of the underlying populations evolves, we make available our comprehensive catalog of events, including the subthreshold population of candidates, and the posterior samples of our source parameter estimates."

  abstract: "Compact binary systems emit gravitational radiation which is potentially detectable by current Earth bound detectors. Extracting these signals from the instruments' background noise is a complex problem and the computational cost of most current searches depends on the complexity of the source model. Deep learning may be capable of finding signals where current algorithms hit computational limits. Here we restrict our analysis to signals from non-spinning binary black holes and systematically test different strategies by which training data is presented to the networks. To assess the impact of the training strategies, we re-analyze the first published networks and directly compare them to an equivalent matched-filter search. We find that the deep learning algorithms can generalize low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) signals to high SNR ones but not vice versa. As such, it is not beneficial to provide high SNR signals during training, and fastest convergence is achieved when low SNR samples are provided early on. During testing we found that the networks are sometimes unable to recover any signals when a false alarm probability <10^-3 is required. We resolve this restriction by applying a modification we call unbounded Softmax replacement (USR) after training. With this alteration we find that the machine learning search retains ≥97.5% of the sensitivity of the matched-filter search down to a false-alarm rate of 1 per month."

  abstract: "Gravitational waves from the coalescence of compact-binary sources are now routinely observed by Earth bound detectors. The most sensitive search algorithms convolve many different pre-calculated gravitational waveforms with the detector data and look for coincident matches between different detectors. Machine learning is being explored as an alternative approach to building a search algorithm that has the prospect to reduce computational costs and target more complex signals. In this work we construct a two-detector search for gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers using neural networks trained on non-spinning binary black hole data from a single detector. The network is applied to the data from both observatories independently and we check for events coincident in time between the two. This enables the efficient analysis of large quantities of background data by time-shifting the independent detector data. We find that while for a single detector the network retains 91.5% of the sensitivity matched filtering can achieve, this number drops to 83.9% for two observatories. To enable the network to check for signal consistency in the detectors, we then construct a set of simple networks that operate directly on data from both detectors. We find that none of these simple two-detector networks are capable of improving the sensitivity over applying networks individually to the data from the detectors and searching for time coincidences."
